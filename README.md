## Description

This repository contains two coding projects, exploring the use of the python csv module to read, manipulate, and write data from .csv files. 

The project is divided into the following two sub-projects:

### 1. [PyBank - click for .py file](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/tree/main/PyBank)

The [main.py](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/main.py) script analyzes the [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) file, reading in the two columns: 'Date' and 'Profit/Loss', and calculating the following:

1. The number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total profits/losses

3. The average change in profits/losses across the period 

4. The greatest increase in profits

5. The greatest decrease in profits

The results of the analysis are then written to the terminal and the file [analysis.txt](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/analysis/analysis.txt)

### 2. [PyPoll] (https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/tree/main/PyPoll)

The [main.py](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/main.py) script analyzes the [election_data.csv](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) file, reading in the three-columns: 'Ballot Id', 'County' and 'Candidate' and calcuating the following:

1. The total number of votes

2. A list of all unique candidates

3. The percentage of votes cast for each candidate

4. The total number of votes cast for each candidate

5. The winner of the popular vote

The results of the analysis are then written to the terminal and the file [analysis.txt](https://github.com/STWoodbury/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/analysis/analysis.txt)
